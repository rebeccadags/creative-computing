  In some ways, could the quality of our websites be more impoartant thant the
  quality of our actual works?  For example, if the work is beautifully executed,

  be a mass amount of the same art piece.  Does this make it less expensive? And
  is it possible that this makes art less impressive? This idea that just any one
