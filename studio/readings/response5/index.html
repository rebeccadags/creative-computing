<h1> Reading 5 </h1>

<p>
  The reading talks about utilizing the web in poetic and intransigent ways.
  Are there any realistic ways that people can 'hand-code and self-publish
  experimental web art and writing projects'.  I feel that if people want to make
  a sturdy salary then they need to go down the path of 'right answer' web development.
  Articles like this sometimes feel unrealistic to me, because it seems that once entering
  the real world we don't get to be as creative anymore as we do in school.
  Is there something I don't know that makes the message of this article more
  relevant to the industry than it appears?
</p>

<p>
  It talks about how in the mid-90's, this handmade style flourished?
  Is our current generations of the industry too uptight with the way
  we market ourselves as companies and as artists?
