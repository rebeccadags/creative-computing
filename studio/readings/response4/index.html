<h1> Reading 4 </h1>

<p>
I find it interesting how the reading argued that "Design is added value.
En masse, designers throw themselves into desires instead of needs."  I wonder
if this could be potentially harmful to our psychology, but I feel it's already
taken its course on us. However, I find it super cool how designers can make people
want things, seems like such an underappreciated super power in business.

<p>
"Is a designer someone who thinks up ideas, designs, produces and sells, or someone
who holds a mouse and drags objects across a computer screen?" Sometimes I feel that
in the industry, designers must feel so creatively drained, or even worse, feel as
though they don't get to be creative when they are making things that are so heavily
geared towards sales.
