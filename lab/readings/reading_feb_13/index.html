<h3> What happens when you create a flexbox? </h3>

<p>
  Flex boxes are box structures that in a way act as bricks that can be moved around.
  Flex boxes allow coders to more easily move things using media query ultimately making sites more responsive.
  The automatic positioning for flex boxes is rows.  If you do not specify a different type of arangement within
  the code they will make rows.  Defining which arrangement you want can provide coders with variations of layouts
  that can be easily created.

<h3> What do we mean when we say responsive? </h3>

<p>
  Overall, when we say responsive, we imply that a site is capable of changing it's dimensions according to the
  screen size.  However, there are many designers that believe that there are a lot of different ways for working
  with responsive design. More recently, "responsive" design has been used more thoughtfully.  Instead of just
  making things size up or down based on screen size, responsive web design has been more open minded to new ideas.
  Some believe, that soon responsive design may become so mainstream that it will ultimately just blend in with our
  original concept of web design.
