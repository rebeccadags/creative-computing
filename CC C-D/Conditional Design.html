       <strong>Conditional Design Project:</strong>
       <br> Instructions: <br>
       Each player starts on a 18x24 inch piece of paper with different colored markers. <br> 1. Each player will have 5 seconds to draw a spiral (of any size) anywhere on the page. <br> 2. The next player’s spiral must connect to either the center or end of the last player’s spiral (cannot be branched from any random curve/side). <br> 3. Players have the option to overlap spirals or branch theirs onto a clean space on the page. <br> 4. All players will take turns drawing connecting spirals until the page is full.
