       <strong>Why do you hike?</strong><br>I hike because my family has always been the outdoorsy type.  We were the kind of family that would rather go camping out west for a week than to <a href="https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/">Disney World.</a>   Being outside, being with the ones I love, and exploring life's beautiful creations is why I hike.<br><strong>What do you normally wear while hiking?</strong><br>While hiking I normally wear leggings, a t-shirt of some shorts (preferable my yellow <a href="https://www.lifeisgood.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-LIG2015-Site/default/Home-Show?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIyY_mrtyx3QIVQj0MCh2Ktg9fEAAYASAAEgLVqvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds">life is good t-shirt</a>), bean boots with high socks (I don't want to get any blisters) and my favorite baseball hat at the moment which ever that may be.<br><strong>What items do you bring with you?</strong><br>It all depends on what kind of hike it isâ€”day or overnight.  Typically I only do day hikes and in which this case I'll only bring my water bottle and my phone. It would be a pain to carry anything else.<br><strong>What season is the best for hiking?</strong><br>Definitly fall!  This is because it's not too hot to where I'm drenched in sweat but not too cold to where I can't feel my fingers.  Its a happy medium!<br><strong>What do you do while hiking other than walk?</strong><br>Other than walk, I like to sometimes play <a href="https://www.winfieldsoutdoors.co.uk/blog/favourite-hiking-playlists/">music</a> from my phone, take photos of beautiful landscapes, or if my dog comes along, play catch with him.<br><strong>Is it enjoyable just because of the outdoors? Or is there another element that makes it worth it?</strong><br>Other than the outdoors, I enjoy hiking because it gives me a chance to remove myself from the hassle and fuss of everyday life.   It's a time where I can disconnect and truly live life in the moment.  Along with this, it reminds me of who I am, where I come from, what I've been through and how lucky I am to be given such a life.
